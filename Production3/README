					Project 3
Purpose
This project thread is creating the address lines that a assembler would make in through
the sicasm command. This is pass 1 of a sic/xe program which then leads into pass 2, which
will the last project for this class. I used two HashTables one to hold the know commands
and the other to old the "TEST" file command or basic the pgm before the pgm.lst and pgm.obj
I hashed the key and used the value as a secondary finder for some parts of the program.
This program show the true purpose of a step by step work out of what how the addresses
are caluclated for each SIC/XE program. A structures program like this will make pass 2 
project simplier

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Source Files:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assembler_main.java:the main code that drives the program and pass1.
DataItem.java: the Node class that holds all the values for the hashtable.
HashtableQuad.java: a hashtable that performs both linear and Quadratic but main Linear
		    stores the DataItems in a DataItem array, using hashing.
Makefile: a file that pre compiles all the code due to a command called Make
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input Files:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SICOP.txt: all the predefined instruction with their hex values in a text file.
	   this is what is going to be used to compare the instruction to the test file.
Testfile.txt: a file that would be used to pass into the assembler to in SIC/XE.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Output:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing to Output everything going to console.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Executation:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Execuation of the program to do pass 1 work
Note:please use my very of SICOP that way the spacing does not mess up.

Step One: After unshar of the program you will see 3 source files and two input files
Step Two: type make and wait till the test "Everything is Down" before continuting forward
Step Three: perfore the following commands:

		java assembler_main SICOP.txt TestFile.txt

Note:Step Three can be done again with  a dffrent "test fie" just change the name and make 
sure it is located in the directory. In case you would like to test more examples of your own.
